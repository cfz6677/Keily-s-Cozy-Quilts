        <p>
          I was born in Arizona but have been relocated several times throughout
          my life. My husband and I moved to Arizona in July of 2014 to be
          closer to family and to start a family of our own. We love spending
          time outdoors at soccer games, hiking and swimming. I can remember
          watching my mom make our clothes and blankets even as a young kid. I
          made my first quilt all by myself for my husband’s Yia-Yia. I enjoyed
          it way more than I thought I would and of course Yia-Yia loved it!
          2014 is where my quilting journey truly began. My mom and I took the
          plunge and purchased a Gammill Statler Stitcher in 2018. We fell in
          love immediately! We are the perfect team. My mom is an amazing piecer
          and I do all the Gammill Statler Quilting. We love working together
          and passing on the tradition. My girls and nieces even show an
          interest! I would be honored to complete your beautiful piecing work
          with my quilting.
